AMOGUS SUSSY DABABY DRIFT GAME , is an amazing drift game. Your goal of the game is to beat the levels with as many points as possible. 

Game made by Leo Jenkins.

### Basics
Navigate throught the levels by drifting around the corners while avoiding driving off the road or losing your health.

Gain points by drifting around the corners and maintaining your drift for as long as possible. 

Keep your health as high as you can. You lose health by hitting the cones. Once you die you lose your whole score and restart the level. Hitting a barrier is an instant fail.
